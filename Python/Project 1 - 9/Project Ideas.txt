"""Goal:
Create a standalone Python script with 5 reusable utility functions that solve different problems. Each function must:

Be defined with def and parameters.
Return a value or print a result.
Be called/invoked in your script to demonstrate it works.

Example Functions (Pick 5 or Invent Your Own):

Password Generator: Generates a random password of given length.

Unit Converter: Converts miles to kilometers (or other units).

Prime Checker: Returns True if a number is prime.

String Reverser: Reverses an input string without using [::-1].

List Sorter: Sorts a list numerically/alphabetically without .sort().

Temprature Advisor: Advises "Wear a jacket" if temp is below 15Â°C.

Make a slot machine using def functions.
